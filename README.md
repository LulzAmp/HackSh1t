# HackSh1t
Hackshit is a program for both [Windows](https://github.com/LulzAmp/HackSh1t/tree/master/Windows/) and [Linux](https://github.com/LulzAmp/HackSh1t/tree/master/Linux/), hackshit runs on PHP, so make sure you've got that installed. Hackshit consists of two seperate parts, a client and a server (which you can run either locally or externally).

### Functions
Currently, HackSh1t can't do much yet. It can generate a UDP DoS Attack, with basic PHP functions. Maybe I'll add some more soon. I'm kinda done with this project though.
